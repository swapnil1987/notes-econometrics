# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **Doctoral Econometrics: Theory and Computation**, a comprehensive course designed for PhD students in economics and related fields.

## About This Book

This book provides a rigorous treatment of econometric theory while emphasizing computational implementation. Each chapter combines:

- **Mathematical foundations**: Theorems, proofs, and derivations
- **Computational implementation**: Python code with NumPy, SciPy, and statsmodels
- **Applied examples**: Real economic data and empirical applications
- **Exercises**: Both theoretical problems and coding assignments

## Prerequisites

Students should have:

- Strong background in calculus and linear algebra
- Basic probability and statistics
- Programming experience (Python preferred, but not required)
- Familiarity with economic theory

## Course Philosophy

Modern econometrics requires both deep theoretical understanding and computational proficiency. This course bridges the gap between abstract mathematical results and their practical implementation, preparing you for empirical research.

## Software Setup

All code examples use Python with the following main packages:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm
```

See the installation guide for setting up your environment.
